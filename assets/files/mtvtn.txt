Hello, 
My name is mohamed amine griche and I'm writing to express my interest in the Web Dev Intern position.
I have been working as a full stack web developer freelancer since 2017, and this opportunity is my key for a real professional experience with a professional team that makes and real-world projects - not just skinny projects like I used to work on -, and I am willing to work my hardest and do my best, and willing even to leave my country to make it a success and evolve my skills and develop new ones, I have been developing with javascript for more than two years and I am so comfortable with it especially in the front-end.
I’m so confident I’d make a great fit this position, you can check my website "http://am-77.github.io/" for more details about me and my github account "https://github.com/AM-77" to see some of the projects I've worked on .
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hear from you soon.
